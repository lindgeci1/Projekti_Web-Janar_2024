                    <p>
                        A torrent of prominent brands halted their advertising on X on Friday, dealing a massive reputational blow to Elon Musk’s social media company after his public embrace this week of an antisemitic conspiracy theory favored by White supremacists.
                        The high-profile advertiser revolt includes some of the world’s largest media companies, such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, Comcast, Lionsgate and Warner Bros.

                            A scientific instrument built in Wales will lead the search for life on Mars at the end of this decade. Enfys, meaning "rainbow" in Welsh, is an infrared spectrometer and will be assembled at Aberystwyth University.
                            It will be fitted to the European Space Agency's Rosalind Franklin rover, which launches to the Red Planet in 2028.
                            Enfys will work alongside the robot's other camera systems to identify the most promising rocks to drill and test for evidence of ancient biology.

                            Nissan will invest $1.4 billion to update its factory in northeast England to make electric versions of its two best-selling cars, a boost for the British government as it tries to revive the country's ailing economy.
                            The Japanese automaker manufactures the gasoline or gas-hybrid Qashqai and smaller Juke crossover vehicles at the factory in Sunderland, which employs 6,000 workers.

                            One of the world’s largest icebergs is drifting beyond Antarctic waters, after being grounded for more than three decades, according to the British Antarctic Survey.
                            The iceberg, known as A23a, split from the Antarctic's Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986. But it became stuck to the ocean floor and had remained for many years in the Weddell Sea.
                            The iceberg is about three times the size of New York City and more than twice the size of Greater London.

                    <p>
                        Apple’s NameDrop feature in iOS 17 is having a bit of a viral moment. Across the United States, police departments are warning adults to turn off the contact-sharing feature on their iPhones and their children’s devices. In addition, a widely shared TikTok video, with over 2 million views, describes how the feature lets strangers at the gym or on the bus steal all your information. The catch? It’s not true. You shouldn’t worry about NameDrop being some huge security risk.

                        The Ministry of Communication and Information in Indonesia has implemented a new policy that requires all citizens to have a digital ID. This policy aims to enhance public data security in the digital space.
                        Director General of Informatics Applications, explained that program will be developed in accordance with the Personal Data Protection Law. Its purpose is to validate the data owner and prevent the misuse of personal identities. Implementation of the policy is expected to improve public data security and reduce the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information.

The company is now authorised to launch the first commercial satellite broadband service in India. This approval opens the door for OneWeb to deliver high-speed, low-latency internet connectivity to customers across India once spectrum allocation is granted by the government.

                        Despite growing excitement that spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) will soon win regulatory approval, some cryptocurrency ETF pioneers plan to sit out what is expected to be a fierce industry battle for market share.
                        Demand for a bitcoin ETF, which would allow retail and institutional investors to easily bet on the price of the world's biggest cryptocurrency, is expected to draw in as much as $3 billion from investors in the first few days of trading and pull in billions more thereafter.

                    <p>
                        The battle over the most consequential technology in decades is getting ugly, fast. OpenAI’s incredible upheaval — with former CEO Sam Altman caught in the middle — could have broad implications for who gets to control the future of artificial intelligence.
                        A year ago, OpenAI was an obscure startup that unleashed a technology so powerful, it almost immediately invited comparisons to Prometheus bringing fire down from the realm of the gods. ChatGPT — the impressively human-sounding artificial intelligence tool — and the scrappy nonprofit that built it, quickly became synonymous with the emerging field of generative artificial intelligence.

                        The FBI is warning consumers against using public phone charging stations in order to avoid exposing their devices to malicious software.
                        Public USB stations like the kind found at malls and airports are being used by bad actors to spread malware and monitoring software, according to a tweet last week from the FBI’s Denver branch. The agency did not provide any specific examples.
                        “Carry your own charger and USB cord and use an electrical outlet instead,” the agency advised in the tweet.

                        A complex but concerning method of gaining control over a user’s iPhone and permanently locking them out the device appears to be on the rise.
                        Some iPhone thieves are exploiting a security setting, called the recovery key, that makes it nearly impossible for owners to access their photos, messages, data and more, according to a recent Wall Street Journal report. Some victims also told the publication their bank accounts were drained after the thieves gained access to their financial apps.

                    <h3>Google to begin deleting inactive accounts this week</h3>
                    <p>
                        That Google account you haven’t checked in years might be getting wiped this week.
                        Beginning Friday, Google is moving ahead with its plan to delete accounts that have been inactive for at least two years.
                        The company announced the new policy back in May, saying it’s intended to prevent security risks: Internal findings show older accounts are more likely to rely on recycled passwords and less likely to employ up-to-date security measures like two-step-verification, making them far more vulnerable to issues like phishing, hacking and spam.
