                        The timing could not have been better with the Copa America taking place there next year and the final set to be played in Miami at the Hard Rock Stadium on July 14. The Club World Cup is due to be held in the States in 2025, and what will be the biggest World Cup yet is coming to the USA, Canada and Mexico in 2026.
                        When it comes to a well-oiled machine looking to promote and grow a brand, nobody does it better than the USA.

                            Cristiano Ronaldo told a referee to overturn a penalty awarded in his favor during Al-Nassr’s Asian Champions League game against Persepolis.
                            The act of sportsmanship occurred in the second minute of Monday’s match as Ronaldo was brought down in the box, prompting referee Ma Ning to award a penalty to the home side.
                            But the Portuguese star approached the referee and argued that the decision should be reversed.

                        <p>
                            And so the curtain falls on a Formula One season dominated by Max Verstappen and his Red Bull team, with the Dutchman securing a record-extending 19th victory of the year at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.
                            Never before has the sport seen a driver win with such regularity and ease, the three-time world champion again comfortably crossing the finishing line first at the season-ending race at the Yas Marina Circuit.
                            The 26-year-old’s victory moves him to third on the all-time list of career F1 wins with 54 overall, behind seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton, who has 103 victories, and Michael Schumacher on 91.

                            NBA superstar LeBron James suffered the worst loss of his legendary career on Monday as his Los Angeles Lakers side was routed by 44 points on the road by the Philadelphia 76ers, 138-94.
                            Per the NBA, the biggest margin that James had lost by coming into Monday’s matchup was 42 points, when the Lakers were thrashed by the Indiana Pacers in 2019.

                        Ever since he joined Manchester City in June 2022, Erling Haaland has scored goals and broken records and, on Saturday against Liverpool, the striker continued to make his mark on history by scoring his 50th league goal for the reigning Premier League champion.
                        No player in Premier League history has reached half a century of goals quicker – Haaland doing so in 48 games.

                    Woods underwent ankle surgery in May after enduring “constant” pain across his three rounds at Augusta National the previous month, only his second competitive appearance of 2023

                        Formula One driver Lance Stroll will miss Sunday’s Singapore Grand Prix after the Canadian suffered a huge crash in Saturday’s qualifying, his Aston Martin team said.
                        Pushing to make it through to the next round of qualifying, Stroll crashed into the barriers at high speed at the final corner at the end of Q1, causing significant damage to his Aston Martin with debris across the track and a front wheel coming off the car.

                        High-speed racing is accustomed to high-speed collisions, such is the nature of the sport.
                        But rarely have we seen a crash as dramatic as what took place on Saturday during the first of Formula E’s double-header of races in Rome.
                        On turn six of the ninth lap, Jaguar driver Sam Bird – leading the race at the time – appeared to lose control of the back of his car before colliding with the barrier to spin his car into the middle of the track.

                    <p>
                        Rafael Nadal says he’s not setting any “deadlines” for his long-anticipated return to tennis, with the Spaniard still recovering from a hip injury.
                        The 22-time grand slam champion has been out of action since the Australian Open in January and underwent surgery in June which ruled him out for the rest of the 2023 calendar.
                        Earlier this month, Australian Open’s tournament director Craig Tiley said Nadal would make his return at the 2024 edition, though following those comments, the Spaniard’s representative Benito Pérez-Barbadillo told CNN that there were “no dates confirmed yet.”

                        Max Verstappen further cemented his status as the dominant driver of his generation with a historic victory at the Italian Grand Prix, his 10th consecutive race win.
                        No Formula One driver has ever won as many races in a row in a season. The Red Bull driver had matched the previous all-time record of nine, set by Sebastian Vettel 10 years ago, at last weekend’s Dutch Grand Prix.

                            For the briefest of moments, Camilo Villegas simply stood motionless, staring down at the hole and the ball that had just trickled into it. Then, accompanied by the deftest pump of his right fist, he turned his gaze skyward and whispered a message. “Mia, thanks for inspiring me.” Nine years and 8,496 holes since his last win on the PGA Tour, Villegas was a champion again, as a two-stroke victory at the Bermuda Championship earlier this month sealed a long-awaited return to the winner’s circle.

                            If snagged at that price, it would be the most valuable football jersey sold at an auction. Brady’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers No. 12 jersey will be featured in an auction held by RM Sotheby’s and Wynn Las Vegas in association with Formula 1 Las Vegas Grand Prix on November 17, according to auction organizers. Its listed price range is between $1.5 million and $2.5 million.
