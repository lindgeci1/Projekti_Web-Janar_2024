                    <p>England and Real Madrid midfielder Jude Bellingham has won the 
                        2023 Golden Boy award - given to the best under-21 player in Europe's top flights.
                        Bellingham, 20, moved from Borussia Dortmund to Real in the summer and has scored 13 goals in 14 appearances.
                        This award comes after he was recognised as the best under-21 player in world football 
                        at the Ballon d'Or ceremony in October.
                        Deep into injury time, he latched onto Luka Modrić’s cross and volleyed a late winner into the net to sink Barcelona and prompt wild celebrations on and off the field.

                            <p>
                                Shein has confidentially filed to go public in the U.S. as the Chinese-founded fast-fashion juggernaut looks to expand its global reach with a long-rumored initial public offering, CNBC has learned. 
                                The retailer was last valued at $66 billion and could be ready to start trading on the public markets as soon as 2024, people familiar with the matter said Monday. 
                                It is unclear how much the company is currently worth, but its valuation has been a central point of debate among Shein and the advisors it’s working with, people familiar with the matter said.

                        <p>
                            Unless you’re an avid currency collector, an employee of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, or work at the Federal Reserve, you likely didn’t know that last year a record number of $50 bills were printed.
                            Last year, the government printed 756,096,000 of those bills — the highest total of the denomination printed in one year in more than 40 years. If you put all those $50s together, you’d have about $37.8 billion. That’s enough to afford Taco Bell’s parent Yum Brands, Inc. $35.3 billion market cap.

                        The high-profile advertiser revolt includes some of the world’s largest media companies, such as Disney, Paramount, NBCUniversal, Comcast, Lionsgate and Warner Bros.

                        A scientific instrument built in Wales will lead the search for life on Mars at the end of this decade. Enfys, meaning "rainbow" in Welsh, is an infrared spectrometer and will be assembled at Aberystwyth University.
                        It will be fitted to the European Space Agency's Rosalind Franklin rover, which launches to the Red Planet in 2028.
                        Enfys will work alongside the robot's other camera systems to identify the most promising rocks to drill and test for evidence of ancient biology.

                        The Japanese automaker manufactures the gasoline or gas-hybrid Qashqai and smaller Juke crossover vehicles at the factory in Sunderland, which employs 6,000 workers.

                        One of the world’s largest icebergs is drifting beyond Antarctic waters, after being grounded for more than three decades, according to the British Antarctic Survey.
                        The iceberg, known as A23a, split from the Antarctic's Filchner Ice Shelf in 1986. But it became stuck to the ocean floor and had remained for many years in the Weddell Sea.
                        The iceberg is about three times the size of New York City and more than twice the size of Greater London.

That process ended up destroying the Super Heavy booster, which erupted into a ball of flames over the Gulf of Mexico. But the Starship spacecraft was able to briefly continue its journey.</p>

                        The pause took place from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. local time (3 a.m. to 7 a.m. ET) Sunday, according to an IDF spokesperson. 
                        At the southern part of Rafah city is the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt– the only crossing in and out of Gaza that is not controlled by Israel, making it the sole option for foreigners trying to leave the besieged enclave.</p>

                    <p>The British government is braced for a tricky weekend.
                        Tricky because Rishi Sunak, a prime minister whose grip on power appears to slip at every turn, is a crisis-time leader who seemingly struggles with handling crises.                           
                        On Saturday, the UK will mark Armistice Day – the date commemorating the de-facto end of World War I. Also on Saturday, pro-Palestinian protesters will march through central London demanding a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict. The march will end outside the US embassy in south London.</p>

                        <p>
                            Aston Villa came from behind in a pulsating encounter at Tottenham to claim a 2-1 win and hand Ange Postecoglou’s side their third successive defeat.
                            There were emotional scenes before kick-off as both sets of supporters paid tribute to former Spurs boss Terry Venables, whose death at the age of 80 was announced on Sunday.

                        <h3>Francesco Bagnaia wins Valencia MotoGP to retain title as Jorge Martin crashes out</h3>
                        <p>
                            Ducati's Francesco Bagnaia won the season-ending Valencia GP to retain his MotoGP title after his only rival Jorge Martin crashed out early in the race.
                            Pramac Racing's Martin clipped Marc Marquez's Honda in the sixth lap, causing both drivers to crash out and hand Bagnaia the title.
                            However, on the second lap he dropped back to eighth after clipping Bagnaia's bike, although he was able to stay in the race.
                            A few laps later a second collision, this time with Marquez, ended his race.

                        <h3>Ultraprocessed foods now account for two-thirds of calories in the diets of children and teens</h3>
                        <p>
                            Children and teens in the United States now get more than two-thirds of their calories from ultraprocessed foods, an analysis of almost two decades worth of data has found.
                            Ultraprocessed foods – such as frozen pizza, microwave meals, packaged snacks and desserts – accounted for 67% of calories consumed in 2018, up from 61% in 1999, according to research published in the medical journal JAMA Tuesday. 
                            The study analyzed the diet of 33,795 children and adolescents nationwide.
